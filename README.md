Angular Geographical Map

NgMap brings the power of Angular to the representation of Geographical Data.

Getting Started
--------------------

THE API IS WIP !!!!

This library provides an angular directive that displays a world map with the data in the attibutes:
* routes: array of routes with originlat, originlon, destlat, destlon, width
* points: array of points with text, pointlat, pointlon

Examples:
```html
<ngmap route="routes" points="points">
</ngmap>
```

The div will take the width of the container and will set the height so it's a square.
